# Electric Line and Potential Simulation (2D Visualization)

<br>
# Overview

This project provides a Python tool to simulate electric fields and potentials generated by simple charge distributions in a two-dimensional space. The simulation visualizes electric lines of force and the scalar electric potential, allowing users to better understand electrostatic concepts.

## Features

- Simulate point charges and uniform charge distributions.
- Visualize electric field lines and equipotential lines.
- Interactive plots to explore electric fields.
- Export plots for presentations or reports.

<br>
## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
